## **Observational Phase Calculator for Cepheids and RR Lyrae**

**Version 1.0** â€“ Developed by **Debasish**, February 15, 2025  

## **Overview**  
This application helps astronomers select **Cepheid and RR Lyrae variable stars** within a specified sky region and calculate their **observational phases** during a given period. For now, it is based on data from **MC Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars from OGLE IV**, sourced from the ðŸ”— [OGLE IV Variable Stars Database:](https://ogledb.astrouw.edu.pl/~ogle/OCVS/)  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Sky Region Selection** â€“ Choose Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars in a specified sky region.  
âœ… **Phase Calculation** â€“ Compute the observational phases of selected stars for a given observation period.  
âœ… **LC Models from OGLE IV** â€“ Constructs the light curve models using the OGLE-IV fourier parameters 

## **Installation**  
To use this tool, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/observational-phase-calculator.git
